# EZ Grader chart

like the popular physical tool for teachers, the user inputs the number of questions and the program spits out a chart of percentage scores for each question missed. This is the round-to-whole-numbers version.

## example:

what is the amount of questions? 34

-0:  100%

-1:  97%

-2:  94%

-3:  91%

-4:  88%

-5:  85%

-6:  82%

etc...
