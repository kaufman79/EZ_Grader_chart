# EZ Grader chart

like the popular physical tool for teachers, the user inputs the number of questions and the program spits out a chart of percentage scores for each question missed. 

## example:

what is the amount of questions? 34

-0:  100.0%

-1:  97.06%

-2:  94.12%

-3:  91.18%

-4:  88.24%

-5:  85.29%

-6:  82.35%

etc...
